# AUTOMATING-EPL
This project involves automating logging into an EPL (English Premier League) account, opening the fixtures of your favorite EPL team, scrapping the page, generating a table of upcoming matches with their dates and venue. Also it takes a full page screenshot of the upcoming fixtures. The project was completed using PUPEETEER and NodeJS .
